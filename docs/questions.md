1. Object orientated programming with classes etc
2. what do things like __this__ mean?
3. Factory functions
4. How much of this set up stuff is worth me learning? surely this gets eaten by AI? how much does the setup change depending on the project goals?
5. one thing I'm finding hard is that knowledge isn't just clearly heirarchicaly building. Sometimes you have to introduce lots of interdependent complicated new things at once and this makes it difficult to see how they each work in isolation. I think I just have to accept the ambiguity and chip away at them over time.

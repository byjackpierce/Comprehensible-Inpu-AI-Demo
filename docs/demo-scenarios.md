⸻

✅ Demo ends (score ≥ 9.5 after 4 sentences)

🧠 Final AI summary:

Your initial guesses focused on dry terrain (like a hill), but you adjusted quickly as the context shifted toward wet, muddy ground. By the fourth sentence, you clearly understood that pantano refers to a swamp or marsh. This was a slower but steady inference arc that shows how accumulating context sharpens meaning.

User selects word: aporia

⸻

🔁 Sentence-by-sentence interaction:

🧠 AI-generated sentence 1:

The philosopher paused, struck by an aporia in his argument — a point where reason seemed to circle back on itself without resolution.

User guess: “a flaw”
🧠 LLM score: 6/10
🧠 LLM feedback: “You’re close — it’s not just a flaw, but a deeper kind of logical deadlock.”

⸻

🧠 AI-generated sentence 2:

In facing the paradox, she found herself in a state of aporia, unsure how to proceed — every path seemed to contradict the last.

User guess: “contradiction”
🧠 LLM score: 8.5/10
🧠 LLM feedback: “Closer — it’s not the contradiction itself, but the mental state caused by it.”

⸻

🧠 AI-generated sentence 3:

The dialogue ends not with a conclusion, but with an aporia — a moment where the speaker admits that no clear answer can be found.

User guess: “mental dead end”
🧠 LLM score: 9.7/10
🧠 LLM feedback: “Exactly — ‘aporia’ refers to a philosophical impasse, a state of doubt or unresolvable uncertainty.”

⸻

✅ Demo ends (score ≥ 9.5 after 3 sentences)

🧠 Final AI summary:

You began with the idea of a flaw or contradiction, which is partially true. Over time, you refined your guess to reflect the internal state of unresolved uncertainty, which is the essence of aporia. This was a great example of inference through abstract reasoning and cumulative context.
